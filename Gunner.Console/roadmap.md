UNSORTED ROADMAP
================

* quick graph
	- pop up a window with a simple graph
* output to elastic search
* yml support
	- gunner myfile.yml (launch gunner with all values in the yammer file.)
* journey support
	- allow us to embed a reasonably decent script, in c# etc, with a simple in memory key/value store for the script.
